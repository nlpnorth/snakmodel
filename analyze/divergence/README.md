# Weight Divergence Analysis

## `embeddings.py`

Analyze the divergence of embedding weights before and after pre-training/instruction tuning. Update the paths in `embeddings.sh` to point to the where the checkpoints are on your local machine.

## `weights.py`

Analyze the divergence of model-internal weights before and after pre-training/instruction tuning. Update the paths in `weights.sh` to point to the where the checkpoints are on your local machine.
